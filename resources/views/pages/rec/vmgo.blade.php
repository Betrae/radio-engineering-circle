    <h4>MISSION</h4>
    <div class="vmgo-box">

      <p>
        Store personnel are trained and constantly evaluated to maintain high standards of operation and quality of service. Recent results from a UAI study by Consumer Vibe Asia[5] (2012 Project Seneca) showed a best-in-class satisfaction score of 7.5 out of 10, for Chooks-To-Go in the food services arena. To keep quality at the desired level, the brand established the BAVI Academy, which provides in-house training for outlet personnel, and other areas of operations.

        Chooks-to-Go has a delivery service for certain areas for a minimal fixed delivery fee of PHP30. Customer Service Associates take telephone orders and relay these to hubs, with software automatically determining the best hub based on customer location.

        For marketing, Chooks-to-Go periodically conducts promotions, which may be on a national or local level. Site selection guidelines are strictly observed, while pre-opening campaigns for new stores are held and in-store merchandising is standardized.[6]

        To keep up with the growth, the brand expanded its broiler and breeder operations. Currently, around 200,000 birds are processed daily, with about half of this set aside for Chooks-to-Go outlets. The company targets an annual production of around 100 million birds by the end of 2013.[3]

        In an awarding ceremony held last December 11, 2013 entitled â€œVolume VIII Second Certificate Superbrands Accreditation and Awarding of Certificate," Chooks-to-Go was the singular roasted chicken brand selected to carry the Superbrands Awards Seal for 2013 to 2015.[4]
